# ANALYSIS-OF-PROPERTY-CHOICE-BEHAVIOUR-BY-RESIDENTS-IN-LAGOS-STATE
This project is aimed at assessing and evaluating the infrastructural and housing considerations that are leading causes of Lagos residents purchasing duplex houses, which have not previously been explored from perspective on consumers

#I.  Dataset Description
---------------------------
The data is a Comma separated Value (CSV) file and it is linked to the domain of Real Estate. The dataset has an original shape of 24326 rows and 8 columns. Since this research is limited to property purchases in Lagos state only. The dataset is filtered to a shape of 18,445 rows and 8 columns. The dataset is in structured format. The (8) property variables are as follows - number of bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, and parking space, title, state, towns, price. The “Town” variable contains a list of 48 locations where properties were sold while ‘Price’ column contained the prices of each property sold in Naira currency (₦).  

II.  Methodology used
---------------------
1. Descriptive statistics of the dataset: Descriptive statistics will be performed entire dataset to see summary of insights about the data
2. Price distribution analysis of properties: The distribution of property prices will be graphically represented by a bar chart. The distribution of property prices will be categorized by an interval of ₦100M (100 million Naira)
3. Analysis in property choice behavior by price category: The aim is to find out the range in volume of funds spent by residents to purchase a property.
4. Analysis of Factors Influencing property choice: The dataset is explored graphically using the stacked column chart to analyze the degree of weightage in any of the attributes – bedrooms, bathrooms, toilet, parking space, price, affecting consumer property choice.
5. Location Distribution of Property Sale: Location distribution analysis is done using bar chart to evaluate area that have higher or lower house demand.

IV.  Key Findings
-----------------------------------
1. More than half of the residents who bought houses bought at a price range below ₦100M (100 million Naira). 
2. Also, eighty-five percent (85%) of total properties sold in the transaction period were bought below ₦200M. 
3. Detached duplex property is the most frequently bought house regardless of the price category the house was sold. 
4. Duplex houses in general were the most sought property type by residents and the major determinant for this type of house was “parking space”. 
5. Lekki town is the buyer’s preferred choice area accounting for almost sixty percent (60%) of property sales. Since detached duplex is the most common property sold at every price category and Lekki town had up to 60% of residents buying houses therefore it is conclusive to say houses sold in Lekki town are detached duplexes
6. Based on the findings, the degree in volume of property sales at Lekki town and the remaining high demand locations could negatively impact the environment by these three probable ways - Firstly, Lekki town and the four towns experiencing high influx of housing development are likely to be face infrastructural congestion attributed by excessive land usage for housing development. Secondly, since residents moving to these four towns are influenced by parking spaces, there is a likelihood that traffic congestion might occur resulting in quicker downgrade of road infrastructure. Thirdly, the impending volume of cars on the road will result in air pollution leading to health problems.
