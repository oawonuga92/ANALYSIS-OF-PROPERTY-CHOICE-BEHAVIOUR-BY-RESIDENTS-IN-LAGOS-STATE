#I. Dataset decription
---------------------------
The data is a Comma separated Value (CSV) file and it is linked to the domain of Real Estate. The data was published on the open data website (https://data.world/abdulkbk/nigeria-houses-price). The data was acquired in 2021 by the same owners. The dataset has an original shape of 24326 rows and 8 columns. Since this research is limited to property purchases in Lagos state only, the property sales transactions of other states in Nigeria are eliminated. The filtered dataset has a shape of 18,445 rows and 8 columns. The dataset is in structured format. The dataset variables is described below 
_______
The (8) property variables are as follows - number of bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, and parking space, title, state, towns, price. The “Town” variable contains a list of 48 locations where properties were sold while ‘Price’ column contained the prices of each property sold in Naira currency (₦).  The dataset satisfies the conditions of a good data, yet one of its major limitations is that it lacks date attributes therefore it is difficult to make any comparison on property prices from a monthly or yearly period.
