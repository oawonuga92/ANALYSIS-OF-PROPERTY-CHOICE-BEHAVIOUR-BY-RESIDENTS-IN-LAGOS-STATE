# ANALYSIS-OF-PROPERTY-CHOICE-BEHAVIOUR-BY-RESIDENTS-IN-LAGOS-STATE
This project is aimed at assessing and evaluating the infrastructural and housing considerations that are leading causes of Lagos residents purchasing duplex houses, which have not previously been explored from perspective on consumers

#I. DATASET DESCRIPTION
---------------------------
The data is a Comma separated Value (CSV) file and it is linked to the domain of Real Estate. The data was published on the open data website (https://data.world/abdulkbk/nigeria-houses-price). The data was acquired in 2021 by the same owners. The dataset has an original shape of 24326 rows and 8 columns. Since this research is limited to property purchases in Lagos state only, the property sales transactions of other states in Nigeria are eliminated. The filtered dataset has a shape of 18,445 rows and 8 columns. The dataset is in structured format. The dataset variables is described below 
_______
The (8) property variables are as follows - number of bedrooms, bathrooms, toilets, and parking space, title, state, towns, price. The “Town” variable contains a list of 48 locations where properties were sold while ‘Price’ column contained the prices of each property sold in Naira currency (₦).  The dataset satisfies the conditions of a good data, yet one of its major limitations is that it lacks date attributes therefore it is difficult to make any comparison on property prices from a monthly or yearly period.

II. METHODOLOGY USED
---------------------
1. Descriptive statistics of the dataset: Since the dataset contains five numerical columns, descriptive statistics will be performed entire dataset to see summary of insights about the data 
2: Price distribution analysis of properties: The distribution of property prices will be graphically represented by a bar chart. The distribution of property prices will be categorized by six columns each having an interval of ₦100M (100 million Naira)
3. Analysis in property choice behavior by price category: Exploratory data analysis is conducted to extract insights on the total number of property types sold for each interval (price category). The aim is to find out the range in volume of funds spent by residents to purchase a property.
4. Analysis of Factors Influencing property choice: The dataset is explored graphically using the stacked column chart to analyze the degree of weightage in any of the attributes – bedrooms, bathrooms, toilet, parking space, price, affecting consumer property choice. Higher weightage will be represented by higher density of color
